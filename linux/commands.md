# Linux Commands

## Linux Tutorials and Introductions

- [UNIX Tutorial for Beginners](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/) covers much of what gets covered in CSC220.  
- [LinuxCommand.org](http://linuxcommand.org) is the website for the CSC220 Linux book *The Linux Command Line*.  The "Learning the Shell" link covers many of the commands we will talk about.  There is also a link to download a free PDF of the book.
- Alex Petralia has a very nice nice overview of some of the most helpful Linux commands - [Learn just enough Linux to get things done](https://alexpetralia.com/posts/2017/6/26/learning-linux-bash-to-get-things-done)
- A good list of [essential Linux commands](https://semanti.ca/blog/?the-most-useful-linux-commands-you-probably-need-to-know)

## Linux / UNIX References

- This [Unix/Linux Command Cheatsheet](https://files.fosswire.com/2007/08/fwunixref.pdf) is a great reference for the most commonly used Unix commands.
- A list of [bash environment variables](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/internalvariables.html).
- [Unix for Poets](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs124/kwc-unix-for-poets.pdf) is a nice write up of text processing in Unix
