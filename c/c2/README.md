# C Pointers

## pointer.c

[Video](https://youtu.be/woUn-BuAvEg) - *Pointers, referencing & dereferencing, allocating memory, sizeof pointers*
This file has examples of referencing & dereferencing pointers and variables.  malloc allocates a certain number of bytes.  If you want to allocate an array, make sure you allocate the number of elements you want times the size of the type of the array.
